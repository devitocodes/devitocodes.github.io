The Devito Compiler
===================

A tutorial series explaining how Devito lowers symbolic equations into executable
code is available `here
<http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/devitocodes/devito/blob/master/examples/compiler>`__.
This tutorial, however, is still work-in-progress; contributions are welcome.

A paper describing the architecture of the Devito compiler is freely available
on `Arxiv <https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03032>`__. This has been submitted to ACM TOMS
and is currently under review.
