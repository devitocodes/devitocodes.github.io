Devito
======

Welcome to the Devito documentation!

`Devito <http://www.devitoproject.org>`_ is a software to
implement optimised finite difference (FD) computation from
high-level symbolic problem definitions. Starting from symbolic
equations defined in `SymPy <http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html>`_,
Devito employs automated code generation and just-in-time (JIT)
compilation to execute FD kernels on multiple computer platforms.
