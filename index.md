**Open Performance portablE SeismiC Imaging (OPESCI)** is a framework for
subsurface imaging. Its development focus on exploiting modern trends in
computer science and numerical analysis to achieve performance portability
across modern many-core computer architectures while maintaining a high level
abstraction that allows rapid research, development and deployment. 

**Research themes**

* Stencil languages, domain specific languages (DSLs) for finite difference.
* DSLs for finite element methods and spectral element methods.
* Code generation, autotuning and compiler research.
* Automatic differentiation.
* Parallel algorithms.
* Multi-layered abstractions and performance portability.

**Documentation**
